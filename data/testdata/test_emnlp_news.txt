And anyway , in my experience , the only part of a newspaper that is really going to pay for itself is the horse racing results .

" That would be good ," Trump said , who also noted that he holds different positions than the former mayor on guns and abortion .

The police - recorded crime figures include a 9 % rise in knife crime and a 4 % rise in gun crime , which are thought to reflect a rise in gang violence largely in London and Manchester .

In the UK , things are rather different and I do not expect the Bank of England to follow the Fed ' s lead quickly .

EU nations would have to vote in favor of the move by around a two - thirds majority , and Greece alone could not stop them .

And the fact that black people feel under - represented in studio movies and big movies , well , it ' s what women thought for a long time , it ' s what gay people like myself still think .

I was putting my money into start - ups where I enjoyed using whatever they ' d come up with .

They aimed the car straight at the driver ( of the truck ) and I ' m pretty sure that they hit him .                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Ms Black said women are not being given enough time to prepare for the fact that they will receive their state pension later than they may have anticipated .                                                                                                                                                   
" We had to change our standards ; it was painful ," he recalled , adding that he was grateful for the countries and companies that had been willing to help N . I . T . C . in those tough times .                                                                                                             
She can ' t understand why someone would shoot her son , her best friend , her child who told her he was never moving out of the apartment because he didn ' t want her to live alone .                                                                                                                         
When people trust the press to be even - handed , it can create the conditions for a robust conversation .                                                                                                                                                                                                      
So I can ' t say for certain at this stage whether or not I may commit to playing the Scottish .                                                                                                                                                                                                                
A lot of the boys say that the team spirit here is something they have never seen before and it ' s really good to have that .                                                                                                                                                                                  
She has now begun attacking Mr Sanders on issues including his lack of foreign policy experience , for supporting pro - gun legislation , and how he would pay for his healthcare and education policies .

Hillary Clinton was riding high in primary polling for the Democrats and Donald Trump was the only surprise in race to the White House .                                                                                                                                                                        
" I think you all got more than a little taste about why this young man still , is still so special to so many ," Clinton said .                                                                                                                                                                                
That doesn ' t mean that Trump is a sure thing yet , but he has , without question , the best chance of any Republican running to claim the party ' s top prize .                                                                                                                                               
You know , when you hear that we spend more money ( by many times ) than other countries , part of the money we spend is we ' re protecting everybody and we ' re not getting very much for it .                                                                                                                
And this is not one of those years , but over the years I ' ve seen numerous black actors and African American actors receive awards and I think that ' s great .                                                                                                                                               
They won the cup so they will be up for it and know what it takes in these semi - finals .                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
He ' s done a great job for us and really has been kind of one of the foundation blocks from the last decade - and - a - half .                                                                                                                                                                                 
And obviously this year was a big storm but I think we had to look at it in terms of big picture rather than this year .                                                                                                                                                                                        
The Sanders argument falls apart when the GOP spokesman is trying to help him and the Republicans run ads trying to stop Hillary Clinton in the primary .                                                                                                                                                       
Police evacuated two train stations in Munich on New Year ' s Eve after receiving a tip - off about a possible terror attack .

Because the air defence system was so expensive , because it ' s so good , I think people might have been trying to cut costs elsewhere .                                                                                                                                                                       
We are in the process here of looking at , as you know , we are talking about the changes in the organization on the personnel side .                                                                                                                                                                           
The core financial argument used by opponents of progress is that Scotland in the UK is in such a bad position that things should stay the same and the same people should stay in charge .                                                                                                                     
The bills include proposals that do things like require a warrant before law enforcement agencies can gain access to emails , provide checks on location - tracking technology , or create new rules about the use of student information .                                                                     
Senator Sanders and I share many of the same goals but we have different records and different ideas about how to drive progress ," Clinton said .

The trick is to recognize the suffering , to understand that these people don ' t risk their lives at sea for a fun holiday , but because they definitely risk losing their lives if they remain in their own land .                                                                                            
She faced that also in later life , with many years passing before another woman lined up with the men .                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The score - line was not the same as that 4 - 1 loss seven years ago but the pain was just as great .

Now is the time for Canada and Mexico to sit down and decide what they want to get out of the next administration .                                                                                                                                                                                             
They are going to take advantage of the opportunities they get and we have to take care of the football because you don ' t want to give it to these guys on a short field .

I think it ' s hard to imagine the outrage that the people working for the United Nations and for the causes of peace and security feel when these kinds of allegations come to light .

A report in Canada ' s National Post last year looked at the high levels of mental health problems in the isolated community .

I work non - stop , I ' m working seven days a week on my case , that ' s all I do .                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
And now it ' s the type of thing that a lot of people are sick and tired of hearing ," he says .                                                                                                                                                                                                                
Sometimes they ' ll join a family they ' ve been involved with , but it ' s extremely important to be provided with professional support and they have very specific needs .                                                                                                                                    
Now , you know , as people watching may not be aware , we have the legislative process for new powers which is , you know , coming to a conclusion .                                                                                                                                                            
But I also think there is a trend throughout the world for people to look closer at their own culture and language - Scotland is a great example of that .                                                                                                                                                      
More than half of Scottish employees have admitted using work time to research and book holidays , according to a survey .                                                                                                                                                                                      
It ' s the same thing as I ' ve always said : if anything were proven , I ' m the first one out .                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Germany saw an unprecedented 1 . 1 million asylum - seekers arrive last year , many of them fleeing conflicts in Syria , Iraq and Afghanistan , and most have come through Turkey .                                                                                                                             
The German Interior Ministry said on Tuesday the refugees and asylum seekers concerned had already said at the border crossing that they did not want to seek protection in Germany but rather elsewhere .                                                                                                      
Given the substantial investment in this series - over many years - one has to wonder quite why it has not been shown , in peak time or even at another time .                                                                                                                                                  
No one knew it at the time , but the stock market reached its low point in March 2009 , just weeks after Obama took office .                                                                                                                                                                                    
It ' s a nice feature to have though - one of the problems with having so much available is it ' s difficult to know what to watch , so having a few options is a nice touch .                                                                                                                                  
They are calling for her to come home and the desire she ' d had that morning to escape is now knocked aside by her need to be with them .                                                                                                                                                                      
Researchers at the University of Michigan report younger patients have better survival rates , often due to more aggressive treatment because their cancer is more advanced -- and had only been caught because the cancer was large enough to cause symptoms .                                                 
That , in turn , could expand the firm ' s pool of drivers and help current drivers buy better cars to improve service .                                                                                                                                                                                        
The last Fox News poll , just two weeks ago , showed Texas Senator Ted Cruz winning by 4 percentage points , with 27 percent to 23 percent for Trump .

He looks very likely to lose South Carolina , and then several delegate - rich states on Super Tuesday , like Texas , Virginia and Georgia .                                                                                                                                                                    
What Cameron wanted : Before the negotiations got serious , Cameron wanted to stop all payments of child benefit going to children living outside the UK , whose parents are working in the UK .                                                                                                                
More years ago than I care to count , after a soccer match in England , I found myself literally in a corner .                                                                                                                                                                                                  
I would have thought that as the order came from the same customer on the same day and from the same range it would be common sense to anyone that they should all go into fewer boxes - instead of all these separate ones .                                                                                   
He ' s an incredible role model for people - I hope he ' s man of the match this weekend playing at six , where he ' s played for us for a number of years .                                                                                                                                                    
He was due to make $ 8 . 25 million under the 2016 salary cap and it was highly unlikely the Panthers would have paid him that salary .                                                                                                                                                                         
Even if the Republican - backed Trump attacks don ' t work in the short - term , Clinton suggested he ' d be vulnerable as the GOP nominee in the fall .                                                                                                                                                        
He ' s pulling in record amounts of small - figure contributions and is rapidly building out a national campaign infrastructure .                                                                                                                                                                               
However , on Saturday it was an excited and delighted trainer that declared : " Let ' s go to Sydney .                                                                                                                                                                                                          
I work in a very small team of four people who work within , but deliberately separate from , a large organisation .                                                                                                                                                                                            
The best you can do is find a partner who ' s " risk seeking " - they want to take on the risk because there ' s a chance they ' ll clean up if you ' ve jumped the wrong way .

Even for a government that appears to be strong from the outside -- China ' s today ; the Soviet Union ' s a generation ago -- there is a very real risk of sudden crisis .                                                                                                                                     
" My main goal is to make viewers smile , laugh , and have a fun time when they come across my work ," he concluded .                                                                                                                                                                                           
Trump - no surprise here - was supported by nearly 9 in 10 of the " tell it like it is " voters .                                                                                                                                                                                                               
Science has shown that exposure to certain programs can make a huge impression , especially if you ' ve had limited exposure to a particular group in the past .                                                                                                                                                
If convicted the person behind the attack could be jailed for up to five years and find  5 , 000 - if the plane came down and crashed then it would be a life sentence .

We have to travel to Ukraine on Monday , so I don ' t see any reason why we can ' t play on the Saturday .                                                                                                                                                                                                      
She then became a single mom and she herself went to jail several times and she ended up spending some time in a crack house .                                                                                                                                                                                  
It ' s about students finding their purpose , to figure out what school will actually do for them in life .                                                                                                                                                                                                     
That ' s why we ' ve issued these guidelines now , specifically for male sexual partners of women who are pregnant .                                                                                                                                                                                            
To date the effects have been felt mainly in the primary sector , but the rising demand for places is now starting to affect secondary schools .                                                                                                                                                                
The original intention had been to hold a relatively short one - and - a - half - hour inquest only hearing evidence from the police .                                                                                                                                                                          
The speaker stressed that he and House Republicans would continue to craft a policy agenda for the Republican presidential candidate to pick up once the primary process was over .                                                                                                                             
But as with medicine for humans in the U . S ., there are risks attached to this relatively easy money .                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Austria , which received 90 , 000 asylum requests last year , has set a limit of less than half that number for this year .                                                                                                                                                                                     
The practice meant that the delays was not officially registered which improved the trust ' s performance on the eight - minute target , in clear breach of NHS national rules .                                                                                                                                
I know they had a tough loss against Golden State ( last Saturday ), but I think they ' re playing really good basketball , and I think , obviously , they ' re going to be a huge factor .                                                                                                                     
Greater Manchester is only at the start of a long process - and its history and politics are very different to Northern Ireland ' s .                                                                                                                                                                           
Two steps without running into someone you do and it ' s kind of escape route between this and some of the downtown restaurants this is where all the action is that it is .                                                                                                                                    
' The only good thing is that I ' ve had amazing support and it ' s given me the chance to tell a lot of people how amazing my husband was .                                                                                                                                                                    
It isn ' t as if it ' s turning around and dying out , it ' s getting worse and worse as the days go by .

Even after losing to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire on Tuesday , Clinton is promising to take her fight for the nomination to the rest of the country .
